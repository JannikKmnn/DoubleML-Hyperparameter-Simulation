## Double Machine Learning (DoubleML): A Simulation Study of the Effect of Hyperparameter Variation on the Estimation of Causal Parameters

The modeling of partial linear regression models (PLR) is done based on Chernozhukov et. al. (2018):

$$Y = \theta_{0}D + g_{0}(X) + \zeta$$

$$D = m_{0}(X) + V$$
